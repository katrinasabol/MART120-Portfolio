        Hi! This is a collection of my work over the semester!

            The main project I worked on was this website, which you can navigate through using the hyperlinks above.

    This was one of the first times working with code in a manner like this. The assignment entailed
    <p></p>
    creating a draw function in order to make a cool geometric shape. I chose a floral like pattern
    <p></p>
    with complimentary pink and purple colors.

    This project was fun to do, especially because I chose a sound board to do, which
    <p></p>
    reminded me of middle school. All of the buttons would play the sound that it says,
    <p></p>
    and I also gave the option to change the colors of the app background, as well as
    <p></p>
    the text on the white background one.

    Making this small minigame proved to be difficult in a few ways, however, once
    <p></p>
    I got the hang of it, it was fairly easy to move from level to level, as most 
    <p></p>
    components stayed constant with the movements and animations. I also decided to
    <p></p>
    make an end game scene so you would know when the game was over.

    In middle school, I did a single project with Alice, but not to this calliber. This was the
    <p></p>
    first time using if/else statements more complexly, which took a lot of computing to make 
    <p></p>
    sure they work correctly and cooperate with the rest of the statements.

    This was probably my favorite project in this class. Getting to draw a funny "self portait"
    <p></p>
    was interesting to do, especially with code. I learned the importance of ordering in
    <p></p>
    Visual Studio Code. This project also took a look of calculating, but it payed off
    <p></p>
    when I correctly put in coordinates and made the picture look well made.

    These two screenshots are from when I animated the previous photo above. I used animations
    <p></p>
    to move certain "body" parts around, both on horizontal and vertical planes. I think this
    <p></p>
    proved to be one of the more difficult projects this semester, as making sure the limits on
    <p></p>
    the movement would not run off of the canvas or glitch.
